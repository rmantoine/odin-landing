                We don't really offer real burgers but you can download this picture of a cartoon burger.

                Please don't take this apple and sell it as an NFT. It should be used to ward off spooky doctors.

                This banana is really shy. They didn't want to be in the picture but crept in just a little bit.

                Broccoli should be fashion. Look at the florets on this bad boy. It rivals the most chic fur accessories.

        I was really skeptical of the three plant based food items and one burger. Mainly because why would anyone include just one burger with three plant based food items? I'm still skeptical honestly.
